# UILTemplate

An IntelliJ IDEA project template for high school UIL competitions.

### Features

- [X] No need to put `src/` prefixes (_cough cough **ECLIPSE**_) or do anything fancy to read in input files. You can test your code and turn it in without changing a thing, easy peasy. :shipit:
- [X] No need to rewrite boilerplate code every time. Just copy the file `ClassTemplate.xml` to these folders, and type `uil` and hit enter in each new file you make:
    > Windows: <your_user_home_directory>\.IntelliJ IDEA<version_number>\config\templates
    >
    > Linux: ~IntelliJ IDEA<version>/config/templates
    >
    > macOS: ~/Library/Preferences/IntelliJ IDEA<version>/templates
